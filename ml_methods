# 📊 Machine Learning Methods in This Project

## 🔍 Overview
In this project, we aimed to model the relationship between **Total Volume (Weight Load × Repetitions)** and **Caloric Expenditure (kcal)** during strength training sessions. We compared three machine learning methods: **Linear Regression (LR)**, **Random Forest Regressor (RF)**, and **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**. The goal was to determine how well each method could predict caloric expenditure based on workout volume and intensity.

## 🧠 Detailed Explanation of Each Method

* **Linear Regression (LR)**:  
Linear Regression models the relationship between the independent variable (Total Volume) and the dependent variable (Caloric Expenditure) by fitting a straight line through the data points. It is simple, interpretable, and computationally efficient. In our project, it achieved an excellent R² score of approximately 0.99 and a very low mean squared error (MSE) of around 0.6 kcal², indicating a nearly perfect linear fit. The scatter plot showed data points closely clustered along the regression line, confirming the high predictive accuracy. However, it assumes strict linearity, is sensitive to outliers, and may underperform if the actual relationship is non-linear.

* **Random Forest Regressor (RF)**:  
Random Forest builds multiple decision trees and combines their outputs to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting. In our analysis, Random Forest achieved a strong R² score of around 0.96 and a slightly higher MSE compared to Linear Regression. The predicted values spread slightly around the actual data, reflecting its capacity to model complex, non-linear relationships. Random Forest is robust to noise and variance, provides feature importance insights, but is computationally more demanding and less interpretable than Linear Regression.

* **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**:  
SVR attempts to fit the best hyperplane within a defined margin of error, using kernel functions to capture non-linear relationships. In this project, we used the RBF kernel for flexibility. SVR achieved an R² score around 0.95, with a higher MSE than the other methods. The scatter plot revealed greater dispersion in predictions, especially at higher total volumes, highlighting SVR’s sensitivity to hyperparameter settings. While SVR can effectively handle complex patterns and small datasets, it requires careful hyperparameter tuning and has a higher computational cost.

## 📈 Comparative Analysis
* **Linear Regression**: Achieved a near-perfect R² (~0.99) and minimal MSE (~0.6). Best for linear relationships, fast and easy to interpret. Low computational cost but sensitive to outliers and assumes linearity.
* **Random Forest**: Strong R² (~0.96) with slightly higher MSE. Handles non-linear relationships, robust against noise, but harder to interpret and more resource-intensive than Linear Regression.
* **SVR**: Good R² (~0.95) but higher MSE. Captures complex non-linear boundaries, flexible with kernel choice, but requires careful tuning and is computationally expensive.

## 🏆 Why These Methods Were Chosen
* **Linear Regression** was used as a baseline due to its simplicity, interpretability, and excellent performance in this dataset.
* **Random Forest** was selected for its robustness against overfitting and ability to model non-linear relationships, making it suitable for complex workout data.
* **SVR** was included for its flexibility in modeling complex patterns using kernels, offering an alternative perspective on the data structure and potential improvements through hyperparameter optimization.

## 🔬 Conclusion
By comparing R² scores, MSE values, and visualizations:
* **Linear Regression** stood out for its simplicity and high accuracy, especially given the dataset’s linear characteristics.
* **Random Forest** provided a robust and flexible approach, effectively modeling complex and non-linear relationships.
* **SVR** showed good performance but required more tuning and computational resources, making it a more complex alternative.

These combined approaches allowed us to comprehensively analyze the relationship between workout intensity and caloric expenditure, leveraging both simplicity and complexity for insightful results.
