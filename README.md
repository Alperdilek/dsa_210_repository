# DSA 210 Project Proposal

## Project Overview
Over the next three months, I’ll be analyzing how my daily habits impact my overall strength, measured through three key compound movements: **Bench Press, Lat Pulldown, and Smith Machine Overhead Press**. By tracking factors such as caloric intake, macronutrient distribution (**protein, carbohydrates, fats**), caffeine consumption, sleep duration, and body weight, I aim to identify the most influential habits for strength development.

Using **data visualization and statistical analysis**, I’ll explore trends, correlations, and patterns to determine which variables contribute most to performance improvements. Through **hypothesis testing and regression analysis**, I hope to uncover whether specific adjustments in nutrition, recovery, or training approach can lead to measurable strength gains.

The process is as follows: **track daily routines, analyze their relationship with strength progression, and refine my approach based on data-driven insights**. Ultimately, this project will serve as a guide to optimizing training and lifestyle choices for maximizing strength potential.

## Objectives
- **Examine the Relationship Between Daily Habits and Strength**  
  Explore how factors like nutrition, supplementation, sleep, and body weight fluctuations influence performance in **Bench Press, Lat Pulldown, and Smith Machine Overhead Press** over time.

- **Identify the Most Impactful Variables**  
  Determine which specific habits contribute the most to strength progression and establish a structured approach to enhance overall performance.

- **Optimize Training and Recovery Through Data**  
  Use **data-driven insights** to refine my approach, making targeted adjustments to maximize strength gains while maintaining recovery and sustainability.

- **Apply Analytical Techniques to a Real-World Problem**  
  Utilize concepts from my **DSA 210 course**—such as **data visualization, statistical modeling, and trend analysis**—to gain a deeper understanding of performance optimization.

---

## Motivation
- **Understanding the Science Behind Strength Gains**  
  Rather than relying on generic workout advice, I want to analyze **my own data** to uncover how daily habits affect my **Bench Press, Lat Pulldown, and Overhead Press** performance.

- **From Guesswork to Precision**  
  Many people make training decisions based on intuition—I aim to take a more systematic and analytical approach to strength improvement by identifying **patterns backed by data**.

- **Bringing Data Science into My Everyday Life**  
  This project allows me to put **data analysis, visualization, and statistical tools** into practice in a meaningful way, bridging the gap between academic knowledge and real-world application.

- **Creating a Sustainable Path to Strength Progression**  
  Beyond short-term gains, my goal is to develop a **long-term strategy** for optimizing strength—one that I can refine and apply not just in this project, but throughout my training journey.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project consists of **three months of daily records**. Here’s what I’ll be tracking:

- **Date**: The specific day of the record  
- **Bench Press (Max Reps at 140kg)**: The maximum number of repetitions completed at **140kg**  
- **Smith Machine Overhead Press (Max Reps at 90kg)**: The maximum number of repetitions performed at **90kg**  
- **Lat Pulldown (Weight for 12 Reps)**: The heaviest weight used for a **12-rep set**  
- **Sleep Duration**: Total sleep duration in **hours**  
- **Caffeine Intake**: The amount of caffeine consumed (**mg**)  
- **Protein Intake**: Total protein consumed (**grams**)  
- **Carbohydrate Intake**: Total carbohydrate consumption (**grams**)  
- **Fat Intake**: Total fat intake (**grams**)  
- **Body Weight**: My **body weight recorded daily (kg)**  
- **Workout Time**: The time of day the workout was performed  
- **Supplements**: Any supplements added or removed during the research period

## Tools and Technologies
The following tools will be used for **data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling**:

- **Python**: For data cleaning, processing, and statistical analysis  
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and data transformations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating scatter plots, heatmaps, and time series visualizations  
- **Pandas**: To manipulate and preprocess data efficiently   
- **Scikit-Learn**: For correlation analysis and predictive modeling  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For organizing analysis and interactive exploration

## Hypothesis Testing
To evaluate the impact of daily habits on strength performance, I will test the following hypotheses:

- **H₀ (Null Hypothesis)**: Daily habits have no significant effect on my total strenght which measured by  **Bench Press (Max Reps at 140kg), Smith Machine Overhead Press (Max Reps at 90kg), and  Lat Pulldown (12RM weight)**.
- **Hₐ (Alternative Hypothesis)**: One or more daily variables (**sleep, caffeine, protein, macronutrient intake, body weight, workout time, or supplements**) significantly impact strength performance in these exercises.

---

## Conclusion
By the end of this project, I aim to answer the following questions:

- **Which daily habits (nutrition, sleep, supplements, training time) most significantly impact my performance in Bench Press, Lat Pulldown, and Overhead Press?**
- **Can implementing small, targeted changes to my routine lead to consistent strength gains?**
- **How does my body weight fluctuate over time, and how does it correlate with improvements or setbacks in performance?**
- **How can the insights gained from this analysis be applied to optimize other areas of my training and personal goals, beyond just strength?**

This project goes beyond improving specific lifts; it’s about **applying a data-driven mindset** to my fitness journey. By leveraging insights from **data science**, I hope to build a comprehensive understanding of how my habits influence my performance, enabling me to make more **informed decisions** in both fitness and other aspects of life. The real power of data lies in its ability to guide **smarter, more effective actions** that drive real progress.

This approach will not only sharpen my **strength training** but also enhance my ability to optimize **other long-term goals**—whether that’s **fitness, personal development, or productivity**.
